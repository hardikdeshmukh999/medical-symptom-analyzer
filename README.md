### Steps:
1. **Data Preparation:** Combine dataset descriptions and dosage.
2. **Text Embedding:** Generate embeddings via OpenAI.
3. **Indexing:** FAISS index for quick retrieval.
4. **Query Handling:** User input matched with embeddings.
5. **GPT Explanation:** AI-generated human-readable responses.
6. **Deployment:** Save FAISS index and data.
7. **Model Loading:** Easy future access without re-training.

### Final Solution:
Real-time medication recommendation system linking symptoms with suitable drugs, clearly explained by AI.

### Tools Used:
- OpenAI API
- FAISS
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Pickle

## üí° Inspiration
Over 50% of OTC medicines in the US are misused due to lack of proper guidance. There are very few AI-powered tools that help users choose safe, appropriate OTC medications.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è What it does
The app recommends medicines based on user-described symptoms by querying a trusted database built from FDA-approved sources. It provides both drug names and safe dosage guidance.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è How we built it
We combined OpenAI‚Äôs embedding models and FAISS for similarity search to match symptoms with medical conditions. Then, we used GPT to generate natural explanations and recommendations. The dataset was curated from multiple trusted medical sources and embedded for fast querying.

---

## üöß Challenges we ran into
- Lack of publicly available, structured OTC medication datasets.
- We had to scrape and merge data from various sources, which was time-consuming.
- Training the model required thoughtful prompt engineering and text preprocessing.
- Here are the medical conditions we currently cover along with sample sizes. Each condition includes medicines, symptoms, and dosage guidance:
  
| Condition               | Entries |
|------------------------|---------|
| Acne, Psoriasis, GERD, Migraine, Eczema, Diarrhea, Osteoarthritis, Pain, Constipation, Insomnia, Colds & Flu, Rheumatoid Arthritis, etc. | 5 each |
| Seizures, Herpes, Diabetes, Cholesterol, Anxiety, UTI, GI Issues | 1‚Äì4 each |

We plan to expand and diversify this further to improve AI understanding.
